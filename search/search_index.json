Recent favorite books Find me exploring the pages of a good book. Some of my recent favorites include: The Dune (1-4) : Frank Herbert's epic sci-fi saga not only offers thrilling adventures but also delves into complex themes of power, ecology, and human potential. The intricate world-building and political intrigue in Dune resonate with my analytical mind. I just start the fifth book... Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes : Daniel Everett's account of living among the Pirah\u00e3 people in the Amazonian jungle provides a fascinating glimpse into a culture with a unique language and worldview. This book challenged my assumptions about language and communication, much like data analysis challenges my preconceived notions about patterns and correlations. SQL Cookbook Query Solutions and Techniques for All SQL User : This practical guide by Anthony Molinaro and Robert de Graaf is my go-to reference for tackling complex SQL queries and optimizing database performance. It's a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of data analysis techniques. Traveling and Food I love exploring new cultures and experiencing different perspectives through food and travel. I believe that both broaden our understanding of the world and enrich our lives. Here is a list of the most memorable restaurants if someone asks me to only pick one from each of these cities: Barcelona : Agreste : gastronomic restaurant by Fabio Gambirasi, great mixture of tradition and avant-garde cuisine, with both catalan and Italian influences and fresh, mostly organic, seasonal, and local products to make interesting and tasty evening wonders. Portland : \u00bfPor Qu\u00e9 No? : amazing and popular local taco restaurants with vibrant vibe and close to large forest Mt. Tabor Park. Be ready to queue because the restaurant is always packed with people! Berlin : Julius : weekly changing menu reflecting the seasons, working closely with small farmers and producers, a Carte Blanche Menu of 8 to 10 courses. London : Artusi : located on Peckham's Bellenden Road in South East London, the Sunday tasting menu gives a homely Italian food experience in a very reasonable price and elevated quality. Paris : El Guacamole : a corner shop that serves traditional Mexican dishes using fresh products from nearby markets and spices imported directly from Mexico. It feels inclusive and welcome, and personally it always projects very easy-going vibe (which is not common in Paris...). Lisbon : SEM : 6 or 8 course tasting menu (depending how you count, i was given more than what it's shown on the menu :p), driven by zero-waste and fermentation technique by kiwi chef George McLeod from new zealand. Open kitchen and very organized smooth operation serve eye-opening and mouth watering dishes. Simple but full of flavours. Selected by Michelin Guide in 2024 Juneau : The Hot Bite : the life savior hamburger and chocolate milk shake after few days in a remote cottage in Alaska. Osaka : \u4ec4\u308a : 8 or 10-course japanese food experience, hidden in the basement of a busy touristic pedestrian street at the heart of Osaka (** unfortunately it required basic level of japanese, and there is no internet in the basement, so you have to really work it to talk to the friendly waiters :D ) Kyoto : \u5c71\u5143\u9eba\u8535 : the famous udon restaurant with insane long queue (waited 2.5 hours in summer time) but it's all worthy it. Taipie : \u7092\u7ffb\u5929 : neighborhood family restaurant with right portion and speedy delivery. It's Down-to-earth eatery fixing up regional staples including seafood, noodles, sashimi & meat dishes. Be aware not to order too much because they are very generous in portions. Taichung : \u7f8e\u8ecd\u8c46\u4e73\u51b0 : offering creative takes on shaved ices made with soy milk, insisting on using non-genetic-modified taiwanese local soy beans and daily hand-made products. No air condition, open air but easy-going vibe. Serve hot soy milk products in winter too. Museums and Museum Studies I enjoy exploring the intersection of art, history, and technology. I find that the process of curating an exhibition shares similarities with data analysis \u2013 both involve carefully selecting and organizing information to reveal hidden patterns and tell compelling stories. I love visiting museums and learning about the art of curation. I'm particularly interested in how museums use technology to enhance the visitor experience and make collections more accessible. my museum studies blog: http://medium.com/museumtalkbar","title":"Hobbies"},{"location":"nav/hobbies/#recent-favorite-books","text":"Find me exploring the pages of a good book.
